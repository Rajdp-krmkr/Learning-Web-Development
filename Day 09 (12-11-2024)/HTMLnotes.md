# HTML Basics: `class`, `id`, `video`, `audio`, and `iframe` Tags

This document provides an overview of the essential HTML tags and attributes, including `class`, `id`, `video`, `audio`, and `iframe`. These elements and attributes help in structuring, styling, and enhancing multimedia content on your webpages.

## 1. The `class` and `id` Attributes

Both `class` and `id` are attributes used for identifying and styling HTML elements. They play a key role in adding CSS or JavaScript to specific parts of the HTML document.

### `class` Attribute
- Used to apply the same styling to multiple elements.
- Can be assigned to several elements across the page.
- In CSS, classes are selected using a `.` (dot) followed by the class name.

**Example:**
```html
<p class="intro">This is an introductory paragraph.</p>
<p class="intro">This is another paragraph with the same styling as the first.</p>
```

### `id` Attribute
- Used to uniquely identify an element within the HTML document.
- Should be unique; each `id` must appear only once per page.
- In CSS, IDs are selected using `#` followed by the id name.

**Example:**
```html
<p id="main-intro">This paragraph has a unique ID for styling.</p>
```

## 2. Multimedia Tags: `video` and `audio`

HTML provides native support for embedding video and audio content directly within your pages, allowing you to enrich the user experience without needing external plugins.

### `video` Tag
The `<video>` tag embeds video content into an HTML document. Various attributes like `controls`, `autoplay`, and `loop` can be used to control playback behavior.

**Example:**
```html
<video src="video.mp4" controls width="600">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

**Attributes:**
- `src`: URL of the video file.
- `controls`: Adds playback controls (play, pause, etc.).
- `autoplay`: Starts playing the video automatically.
- `loop`: Replays the video once it finishes.
- `muted`: Mutes the audio of the video.

### `audio` Tag
The `<audio>` tag is used to embed audio files. Similar to the `<video>` tag, it supports playback controls and can be customized with various attributes.

**Example:**
```html
<audio src="audio.mp3" controls>
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
```

**Attributes:**
- `src`: URL of the audio file.
- `controls`: Adds audio playback controls.
- `autoplay`: Starts playing the audio automatically.
- `loop`: Replays the audio once it finishes.

## 3. Embedding External Content: `iframe`

The `<iframe>` tag allows embedding of external resources such as web pages, videos, or interactive maps directly within the HTML document.

**Example:**
```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400">
  Your browser does not support iframes.
</iframe>
```

**Attributes:**
- `src`: URL of the page to embed.
- `width` & `height`: Specify the dimensions of the iframe.
- `allow`: Grants permissions for the embedded content (e.g., `fullscreen`).
- `frameborder`: Sets the width of the iframeâ€™s border (default is `1`; `0` removes the border).
- `title`: Provides an accessible name for the iframe, helping screen readers identify it.
