### Tasks:

1. **HTML Structure:**  
   Create a simple webpage with the following sections:

   - **Header:** A title and a subtitle for the webpage.
   - **Main Content:**

     - A short article with 3 paragraphs (given below).

     ```
     Typography and text properties are essential aspects of web design, as they define how content appears and is read by users. In this assignment, we explored the concepts of font-family, font-size, font-style, and other text-related CSS properties to enhance the presentation of a webpage. The thoughtful application of these properties helps create a clear visual hierarchy and improves readability, ensuring a better user experience
     ```

     ```
     We experimented with properties like text-transform, text-decoration, and text-indent to add stylistic elements to our webpage. For instance, uppercase transformation in headings and indents in paragraphs helped in creating a professional and clean layout. Additionally, using text-overflow with ellipses provided a practical solution for handling overflowing content. This approach ensures a balance between aesthetics and functionality.

     ```
     Lastly, pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after were utilized to add decorative elements without cluttering the HTML structure. These, along with proper alignment and spacing, showcase how CSS can bring structure and style together in web development. This assignment not only enhanced our understanding of typography but also allowed us to apply creative solutions to common design challenges.

     - A list of your favorite books/movies in either an ordered or unordered list.

   - **Footer:** Your name and the current date.

2. **Typography Styles:**  
   Apply the following styles to your webpage:

   - **Font Family:**

     - Set the entire webpage’s font to a sans-serif font.
     - Use at least two different font families for the header and paragraphs.

   - **Font Size:**

     - Use different font sizes for the header, subheader, and body text.
     - Ensure readability and maintain a consistent hierarchy.

   - **Font Style and Weight:**

     - Use italic font style for subtitles.
     - Experiment with bold or lighter font weights for emphasis in headings or keywords.

   - **Line Height and Letter Spacing:**
     - Adjust the line height of paragraphs for better readability.
     - Add letter spacing to headings for a modern look.

3. **Text Properties:**  
   Use the following text properties creatively:

   - **Text Alignment:** Center align the header and footer. Align the article’s content to the left.
   - **Text Decoration:**
     - Underline the footer text.
     - Apply a `line-through` to any outdated or unavailable book/movie in the list.
   - **Text Transform:**
     - Use uppercase for the header text.
     - Capitalize the first letter of each paragraph.
   - **Text Indent:** Add an indent to the first line of each paragraph.
   - **Text Overflow:** Create a container with a limited width and height. Add text that overflows and apply the `text-overflow` property to show ellipses.

4. **Additional Requirements:**
   - Use at least two pseudo-elements (`::before` or `::after`) to style decorative elements for headings or lists.
   - Experiment with color properties to enhance the visual appeal of the text (e.g., font color and text-decoration color).
