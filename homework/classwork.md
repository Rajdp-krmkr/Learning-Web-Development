Here are some tasks based on **JavaScript Day 6** topics (**DOM Manipulation, querySelector, getElementById, Event Handling, and Modifying HTML Elements**):

### **Task 1: Change Text on Button Click**

- Create an HTML page with a `<p>` tag and a button.
- When the button is clicked, change the text inside the `<p>` tag using `querySelector`.

---

### **Task 2: Toggle Background Color**

- Create a button that toggles the background color of the `<body>` between **lightblue** and **white** each time it is clicked.
- Use `getElementById` or `querySelector` to select the button and modify styles using `style.backgroundColor`.

---

### **Task 3: Show and Hide Content**

- Create a `<div>` with some text and a button.
- When the button is clicked, hide the `<div>` if it is visible and show it again if it is hidden.
- Use `style.display` to achieve this effect.

---

### **Task 4: Count and Display Clicks**

- Create a button that increases a counter each time it is clicked.
- Display the updated count in a `<span>` inside a `<p>` tag.
- Use `innerText` to update the text.

---

### **Task 5: Dynamic Input Field Update**

- Create an input field and a paragraph.
- As the user types in the input field, update the paragraph with the same text in real-time.
- Use `input` event and `querySelector` to get the value.

---

### **Task 6: Change Image on Hover**

- Add an `<img>` tag with an initial image.
- When the user hovers over it, change the image to another one.
- Use `mouseover` and `mouseout` events.

---

### **Task 7: Change Font Size using Dropdown**

- Create a dropdown `<select>` with different font sizes (e.g., 12px, 16px, 20px).
- When the user selects a size, update the font size of a paragraph accordingly.

---

### **Task 8: Add Items to a List Dynamically**

- Create an input field and a button.
- When the button is clicked, add the text from the input field as a new `<li>` in an unordered list `<ul>`.
- Use `createElement` and `appendChild`.
