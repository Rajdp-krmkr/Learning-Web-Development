## 📘 Express Router – Complete Beginner Notes

### ✅ What is Express Router?

`Express.Router()` is a **mini Express application** that helps you organize your routes. Instead of defining all routes in one big file, you can break them into separate **modular route files** and use them like plugins in your main app.

---

### 🧠 Why Use Express Router?

- Clean and maintainable code.
- Reusability of route modules.
- Separation of concerns (each file can handle a different part of your app).
- Better scalability in large applications.

---

### 🧩 How to Use Express Router?

#### 1. **Create a router file** (e.g., `orders.js`)

```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router(); // creating a new router object

// Middleware (optional)
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request to ${req.originalUrl}`);
  next();
});

// Handle different request methods
router
  .route("/:orderId")
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send(`Get order ${req.params.orderId}`);
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send(`Create order ${req.params.orderId}`);
  })
  .put((req, res) => {
    res.send(`Update order ${req.params.orderId}`);
  })
  .delete((req, res) => {
    res.send(`Delete order ${req.params.orderId}`);
  });

module.exports = router; // export the router
```

#### 2. **Use the router in `app.js`**:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const ordersRouter = require("./routes/orders"); // import router

app.use("/orders", ordersRouter); // mount the router at /orders

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

### 🛠 Working Principle Behind the Router

- When you call `express.Router()`, you're creating a **modular routing handler**.
- This router can define routes, middlewares, and handle HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- `app.use('/orders', ordersRouter)` mounts the router so that **all routes defined in it** are **prefixed with `/orders`**.

> For example, a `.get("/:orderId")` in `ordersRouter` becomes `/orders/:orderId` in the actual app.

### ⚙️ Methods You Can Use in Express Router

| Method            | Description                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `router.get()`    | Handle GET requests                 |
| `router.post()`   | Handle POST requests                |
| `router.put()`    | Handle PUT requests                 |
| `router.delete()` | Handle DELETE requests              |
| `router.use()`    | Use middleware on the router level  |
| `router.route()`  | Combine multiple methods on a route |

### 📦 Structure Example

```
project/
│
├── app.js
└── routes/
    └── orders.js
```

---

### 💡 Tip

You can create multiple routers:

- `usersRouter`
- `productsRouter`
- `authRouter`

And mount them like:

```js
app.use("/users", usersRouter);
app.use("/products", productsRouter);
```
