# Homework Assignment: Day 12  

### **Objective**  
Reinforce the concepts learned in the previous classes by practicing CSS box model, universal selector, pseudo-classes, and selectors (element, class, id, and child selectors).  

---

### **Tasks**  

#### 1. HTML Structure:  
Create a simple webpage with the following sections:  

- **Header:**  
  - Contains the website's name.  

- **Navigation Bar:**  
  - Includes three links (e.g., Home, About, Contact).  

- **Main Section:**  
  - Contains:  
    - An **article** with a heading and a paragraph.  
    - A **list** (ordered or unordered) summarizing key points.  

- **Footer:**  
  - Displays your name and the current date.  

---

#### 2. CSS Styling:  

- **Inline CSS:**  
  - Style the footer with a background color and text alignment.  

- **Internal CSS:**  
  - Style the navigation links with different colors for hover, active, and visited states.  
  - Apply a background color to the header and center the text using the box model (padding and margin).  

- **External CSS:**  
  - Style the article heading and paragraph with unique colors and font sizes using element and class selectors.  
  - Apply child selectors to style the list items.  

---

#### 3. Practice Universal and Pseudo Selectors:  

- **Universal Selector:**  
  - Add a global font family and text color.  

- **Pseudo-Classes:**  
  - Use `:hover`, `:nth-child()`, and `:first-child` to style specific elements in the list or navigation bar.  

---

#### 4. Box Model Implementation:  

- Add **padding**, **margin**, and **border** to at least one section (e.g., header, article, or footer).  
- Ensure the layout visually demonstrates your understanding of the box model.

### **Submission Instructions**  

1. Create a folder named `Homework_Day_12`.  
2. Save your HTML file as `index.html` and the external CSS file as `styles.css`.  
3. Push the folder to your GitHub repository.  
4. Share the repository link before the next class.

### **Bonus Task (Optional):**  
- Create a button with hover and active effects using pseudo-classes.  
- Style it with padding and borders to explore the box model further.
