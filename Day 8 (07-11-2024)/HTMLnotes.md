## 1. Label Tag

The `<label>` tag is used to label form elements, making forms more accessible. It links to a specific input using the `for` attribute.

### Example

```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username" />
```

---

## 2. Autofocus and Required Attributes

- **`autofocus`**: Automatically focuses on a specific input when the page loads.

  ```html
  <input type="text" name="username" autofocus />
  ```

- **`required`**: Ensures that a field must be filled out before submission.
  ```html
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  ```

## 1. Inline Elements

Inline elements are elements that only occupy as much width as necessary. They do not start on a new line and allow other inline elements to appear next to them. Commonly used inline elements include:

- `<span>`: A generic inline container for phrasing content, often used for styling.
- `<a>`: The anchor tag for hyperlinks.
- `<img>`: Used to embed images.
- `<strong>` and `<em>`: Used for emphasizing text.

### Example
```html
<p>This is an inline <span>element</span> inside a paragraph.</p>
<a href="#">This is a link</a> and <img src="image.jpg" alt="example image">.
```

### Key Points
- Inline elements flow with the text.
---
## 2. Block Elements
Block elements occupy the entire width of their container and start on a new line. They are commonly used to create structural layout sections. Common block elements include:

- `<div>`: A generic block container, often used for layout or grouping content.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading elements.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs.
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists.
### Example

```html
<div>
  <h1>This is a block element</h1>
  <p>Paragraphs are also block elements.</p>
</div>
```

### Key Points
- Block elements begin on a new line and stretch across the page.
- They can contain both inline and other block elements.

---


## 3. ID Attribute

The `id` attribute provides a unique identifier for an element, allowing you to style or manipulate that specific element. An `id` must be unique within a page, meaning no two elements should have the same `id`.

### Example
```html
<div id="header">This is the header</div>
```

### Usage
- **CSS**: `#header { background-color: blue; }`
- **JavaScript**: `document.getElementById("header").innerText = "New Header";`

### Key Points
- Use `id` for unique elements that appear only once, like headers or footers.
- Avoid using the same `id` multiple times on a single page.

---

## 4. Class Attribute

The `class` attribute groups elements together, allowing you to apply the same style or behavior to multiple elements. Unlike `id`, multiple elements can share the same `class`, and elements can have multiple classes.

### Example
```html
<p class="intro">This is an introduction paragraph.</p>
<p class="intro highlight">This paragraph has multiple classes.</p>
```

### Usage
- **CSS**: `.intro { font-size: 16px; }`
- **JavaScript**: `document.getElementsByClassName("intro")[0].style.color = "green";`

### Key Points
- Use `class` for styling multiple elements in a similar way.
- Classes are reusable and allow for greater flexibility in styling and scripting.

---

## Summary

- **Inline Elements**: Flow with text and do not start on a new line. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`.
- **Block Elements**: Take up full width and start on a new line. Examples include `<div>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`.
- **ID Attribute**: Uniquely identifies a single element. Use `id` for unique elements.
- **Class Attribute**: Groups multiple elements for styling and behavior. Use `class` for reusable styles across multiple elements.

This foundational knowledge of inline vs. block elements and the usage of `id` and `class` attributes is essential for creating well-structured, maintainable HTML documents.
