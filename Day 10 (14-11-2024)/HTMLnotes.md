## HTML Semantic Tags

**Semantic HTML** is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of each piece of content, making it easier for both developers and search engines to understand the structure and importance of content on a webpage. By using semantic tags, we ensure better accessibility, readability, and SEO for our webpages.

### Why Use Semantic HTML?
- **Accessibility:** Helps screen readers interpret the page structure for visually impaired users.
- **SEO Benefits:** Search engines understand and prioritize content better.
- **Code Readability:** Makes it clear what each part of the page is for other developers.

### Common Semantic Tags and Their Uses

| Tag         | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `<header>`  | Represents the introductory section of a webpage, typically containing the logo, navigation links, or a headline. |
| `<nav>`     | Defines a section that contains navigation links. Useful for organizing main and secondary navigation menus. |
| `<section>` | Groups related content into a distinct section of the page. It is often used to create sections within a webpage. |
| `<article>` | Contains independent, self-contained content that could be distributed as a standalone piece, such as a blog post or news article. |
| `<aside>`   | Holds content that is related to the main content but placed to the side, such as advertisements or side notes. |
| `<footer>`  | Represents the footer of a webpage or a section. Often contains copyright information, links, or contact details. |
| `<main>`    | Encloses the main content of the page, typically the primary content related to the page's purpose. |
| `<figure>`  | Used to group media, like images, charts, or code snippets, with an optional `<figcaption>` for captions. |
| `<figcaption>` | Provides a caption or description for the content inside a `<figure>` tag. |
